# COBOL Divide-by-Zero Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs: division by zero.  The `bug.cob` file contains the erroneous code, which results in a runtime exception. The solution is presented in `bugSolution.cob`.

The solution involves adding a check to prevent division by zero.  It is important to consider such edge cases to ensure program stability and avoid unexpected crashes.
